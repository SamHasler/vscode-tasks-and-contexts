The Tasks and Contexts extension for Visual Studio Code implements a task-focused interface.

You can create as many tasks as you want. Anytime you activate a task, the documents you open are attached to that task.

Switching from one task to another closes the current documents and opens the ones you linked to the new task.

Tasks can also be imported from your issue tracker. Currently, an integratio with Trello is provided.


## Features
